   <h1 class="title">Hi! I'm Editor Rust.</h1>
   <center><em>This site is still under active construction, and yes, this is inside a <code>center</code> tag.</em></center>
   <h2>About me</h2>
   <p>I'm a high school student who spends just about all their spare time programming. And a bit of none spare time. I do mostly full-stack web devlopment, with Node as the backend. I enjoy working with JavaScript and CSS, and am a little <i>too</i> determined to make my websites look perfect. Still waiting to work on a project with someone, and only slightly lonely.</p>

   <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
   <p>Linux is the best OS, hands down. Open source, free, a great community, all the features you need and more you don't, and that amazing terminal. What could possibly compete? MacOS has a design that's like 15 years old, and has had no real updates in forever. Also, that price tag! Not everyone has wallets that deep. And Windows is garbage. Also, what's with the new glassomorphism? If only they'd implement it fully. It's just a patched together operating system made for buisnesses. Also PowerShell is the stuff of nightmares.</p>
   <p>Best mobile operating system is... depends. Linux on mobile is a joke. iOS would be best for ordinary people who are willing to shell out for a better OS. Android has <i>all</i> the options, making it a lot like Linux in many ways. So for anyone who knows what they want out of a device should go with Android. And tablets? Android on tablets is a joke. A kinda sad one. No Windows tablets. iPads would be great for anyone who... has a computer and just wants to doomscroll on their couch. It's useless for any real work. So if you want to use a tablet for work, I suppose you're stuck with a Windows device. Or a Surface Book with Linux. It all comes back to Linux, dosen't it?</p>

   <h2>Tools</h2>
   <h3>Software</h3>
   <p>I use Blender for 3D modeling or my failed animation experiments. LibreOffice is great because it's open source, but Google Docs is great because of... everything else. Also it has a web app! I love web apps. I use Inkscape for SVGs (SVGs are amazing, and CSS takes it them to the next level). Clearly I use GitHub for source control, and use GitHub Codespaces for development, at least while it's free. I use Chrome because of feature support for CSS, but I use Firefox for everything else, because it's not Chromium based. Also Opera is great. I've made attempts to use note apps like Obsidian, but now just... remember? It works, okay? For now anyway.</p>
   <h3>OS</h3>
   <p>I use Windows right now (not by choice!), but I've tried Macs and spent time with Linux, mainly Kubuntu. I also tried Deepin which was great, and want to test Zorin OS. Also use ChromeOS for school, and would not recommend it unless you only use the Google ecosystem.</p>
   <h3>Docs</h3>
   <p>I often use Stack Overflow, even though I'm blocked. Yes, I posted <i>one</i> answer, and the person who'd posted the question marked it down, and now I can't post answers. AND can't fix it. I used to use W3Schools, but now stick with Mozilla Docs, because open source and it's much more complete.</p>
   <h3>Languages</h3>
   <p>JSON and Markdown. I know they aren't languages, but still, they're amazing, right? I mainly use JavaScript and Node, of course with HTML and CSS, with Tailwind CSS for styling. For now I use EJS as a view engine, but I want to switch to Vue. MongoDB for database! If you want the password to my database, just look through my old commits. I plan on learning Angular, React, TypeScript, Socket.io, Rust, and Swift. As well as generally learning more about web protocols and cybersecurity.</p>

   <h2>What I do</h2>
   <p>I'm a web developer and designer, and I build open source PWAs while messing about with JavaScript libraries. You might know me as the brilliant developer of Git Organized, or the creator of the world-renowned Chat Experiments. Most likely you haven't heard of me at all, but I'll remedy that soon enough, and you'll grow to rue the day you ever heard of Editor Rust.</p>
   
   <h2>More about me</h2>
   <p>I'm a fan of Linux and Open Source, and am working on contributing to open source projects. I want to do more with RSS, and am a devoted Markdown fanatic. It's so simple and efficient! I believe that SVGs are amazing, and their level of integration into the web is stunning. I consider my self a web designer and developer, and try to balance both those roles in my work. My current workflow includes Node, Express, Tailwind CSS and Vanilla JavaScript, and obviously, being a web developer, CSS and HTML. I believe in cloud IDEs because of convenience and that Linux Terminal, and I use Visual Studio Code, no surprise there. Currently using Github Codespaces. I want to learn more about JavaScript libraries and front end web development, as well as touching into cybersecurity, machine learning, and app development. Currently I'm a student, so I don't get much opportunity to work on my projects, but I still put my best effort into them whenever I can.</p>

   <h2>Work</h2>
   <p>My current big projects are Git Organized, a project management and planning tool for developer projects, and an unnamed chat project, meant to be a public space like Twitter without any politics, controversial topics, or hate, a place to make communities to meet people like you, similar to Discord, and a place for private messaging, like Google Chat. I'm so excited for what both of them will become, so please check them out, and consider contributing!</p>
   <p>Some other work I've done include Hillside Township, an imaginary town with a satirical newspaper, where I can exercise my love of creative writing as well as poke fun at politics and technology (Get Hillside Plus, premium citizenship!). Another website is the Schoolarly Bay, a place for research articles. Some of my friends chipped in with articles, and I can't wait to improve this.</p>
   <p>I also made my own little JS library called Digit, which writes out long numbers in words. I'm still polishing this, and plan on adding time related features, as well as number animation.</p>
   <h2>Games</h2>
   <p>Some of my really old work include some games I made, ah, back in those days when I wanted to only make games. Ha, the world has turned me into a functional programmer now. These early games include dreadful styling and questionable code, so I suggest you proceed with caution.</p>
   <p>Gold Rush was my first game, what really got me into JavaScript and web development. It's an incremental game, inspired by Cookie Clicker, the golden standard for all clicker games. It has exactly one image, and my recent attempts to modernize the UI had made it a disaster zone. Look at me, throwing around terms like UI, and UX, and accessibility. I'm a web designer now, through and through. The game is about as unbalanced math-wise as it gets, and half the ideas are unfinished, but I think I'm done here. Rest easy, Gold Rush.</p>
   <p>Vegetable Dash was my next big thing, and I'm still kinda proud of it. It really helped me get a grasp on core JavaScript features, and helped push my knowledge forward with Node. The whole thing was image-based, and since I was going through my SVG craze, is a little strange. The code will cause you nightmares if Grampa Jenkins doesn't. I love you Vegetable Dash, and maybe one day I'll come back for you...</p>
   <p>Cookin' in the Kitchen is one of my more recent works. It was inspired by an old game I used to play, Cooking Fever. I have hopes of making this multiplayer and all, but I probably won't get to. It was a really cool experiment with drag and drop though.</p>
