         <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
         <p>I'm a high school student in the United States. When I have time, I like to do programming, which has been mostly full stack web dev. Now, I'm learning Kotlin for Android development, trying out Godot for the school Game Dev Club, and writing C++ code for the school robotics team. Currently using the Fedora KDE Spin.</p>
         <br>
         <h2 id="work">Work</h2>
         <p>As mentioned above, I've been just experimenting around recently, working on a bunch of small projects in Python, GDscript, Java, and Kotlin, until I find something good enough to stick with. If you want to see whatever project I'm working on this week, it'll be up on my <a href="https://github.com/hnasheralneam">GitHub</a>.</p>
         <p>A ambitious project I was working on in JavaScript was <a href="https://github.com/hnasheralneam/git-organized">Git Organized</a>, a project management and planning tool; web hosting isn't working right now, but you can set it up yourself if you like.</p>
         <h3>Other work</h3>
         <p>Another small tool I made is <a href="activity-log/">Activity Log</a>, which is meant to be used for tracking time. It's a really cool project, with a nice design and charts and everything. I'm trying to make this an Android app.</p>
         <p>Recently, and <a href="https://github.com/Urdons/">friend</a> and I made a developer profile tool for a hackathon project; <a href="https://codefetch.onrender.com">here it is</a>. Right now it only fetches data from GitHub.</p>
         <p>My really old work includes some games; they are still up on my GitHub.</p>
         <br>
         <h2 id="workflow">Tools</h2>
         <p>Languages: JavaScript, Java, Python</p>
         <p>IDEs: VIsual Studio Code, Android Studio, Jetbrains IDEs sometimes</p>
         <h3>Software</h3>
         <p>Firefox.</p>
         <p>Keyboard layouts are programmer's dvorak (~100wpm) and arabic 101 (~15wpm).</p>
         <p>Fedora 40 KDE Spin, Windows 11 (unfortunatly), and ChromeOS for school.</p>
         <h3>Opinions</h3>
         <p>I use Python, sometimes, when I can't avoid it. The worst parts are varibles and the dependance on indentation.</p>
         <p>The type checking in Java is actually really nice.</p>
         <p>I use open source when possible.</p>
         <br>
