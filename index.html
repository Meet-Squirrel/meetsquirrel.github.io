         <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
         <p>I'm a high school student in the United States. When I have time, I like to do programming, which in the past has been mostly full stack web dev. Now, I'm learning Kotlin for Android development, trying out Godot for the school Game Dev Club, and writing C++ code for the school robotics team. I used to run Linux (Kubuntu), and am waiting to use it again (prob. KDE spin of Fedora).</p>
         <br>
         <h2 id="work">Work</h2>
         <p>As hinted above, I've been just experimenting around recently. Working on a bunch of small projects in Python, GDscript, Java, and Kotlin, until I find something good enough to stick with. If you want to see whatever project I'm working on this week, it'll be up on my <a href="https://github.com/hnasheralneam">GitHub</a>.</p>
         <p>A ambitious project I was working on in JavaScript was <a href="https://github.com/hnasheralneam/git-organized">Git Organized</a>, a project management and planning tool; web hosting isn't working right now, but you can set it up yourself if you like.</p>
         <h3>Other work</h3>
         <p>Another small tool I made is <a href="activity-log/">Activity Log</a>, which is meant to be used for tracking time. It's a really cool project, with a nice design and charts and everything. I'm trying to make this an Android app.</p>
         <p>I also made a small JS library called <a href="digit/">Digit</a>, which writes out long numbers in words. I'm still polishing this, and plan on adding time related features; this is probably the most useful thing I've made.</p>
         <p>My really old work includes some games; they are still up on my GitHub.</p>
         <br>
         <h2 id="workflow">Tools</h2>
         <p>Languages: JavaScript, Java, Python, GDscript, Kotlin, C++</p>
         <p>IDEs: VS Code, Android Studio, Godot built-in, Eclipse, VEXcode (sadly)</p>
         <h3>Software</h3>
         <p>Browser of choice is Firefox, because there is enough chromium in the world.</p>
         <p>Programmer's dvorak (~100 wpm).</p>
         <p>For operating systems, I have to use Windows now, but I hate it every day. As soon as possible, I'm switching to Linux and never looking back. I have used Linux and it is like a dream; one day I'll use it again.</p>
         <h3>Opinions</h3>
         <p>I use Python, sometimes, when I can't avoid it. The worst parts are how variables are declared and the dependance on indentation.</p>
         <p>The type checking in Java is actually really nice.</p>
         <p>I will use only open source when possible.</p>
         <p>There is nothing pinned on my desktop or taskbar; I search when I need something.</p>
