         <h1>Hi! I'm Squirrel!</h1>
         <p>I am a web developer(Is there a minimum age to be qualified? Do you need to be at least working age or age of consent in your country?) and <strong>extremely</strong> unimportant person in general. I use Linux, and that is about the most intresting thing about me. But I have made some stuff! You can see my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/Squirrel-314">here</a>, and check out all the organizations I am in alone. Like my repositories? Please put up issues for any mistakes, and if you have a suggestion, also make an issue. No, I didn't mean it that way, it's just eaisier for me to see.</p>
