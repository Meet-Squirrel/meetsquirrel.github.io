         <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
         <p>I'm a high school student in the United States. When I have time, I like to do programming, which in the past has been mostly full stack web dev. Now, I'm learning Kotlin for Android development, trying out Godot for the school Game Dev Club, and writing C++ code for the school robotics team. Currently using the Fedora KDE Spin.</p>
         <br>
         <h2 id="work">Work</h2>
         <p>As hinted above, I've been just experimenting around recently, working on a bunch of small projects in Python, GDscript, Java, and Kotlin, until I find something good enough to stick with. If you want to see whatever project I'm working on this week, it'll be up on my <a href="https://github.com/hnasheralneam">GitHub</a>.</p>
         <p>A ambitious project I was working on in JavaScript was <a href="https://github.com/hnasheralneam/git-organized">Git Organized</a>, a project management and planning tool; web hosting isn't working right now, but you can set it up yourself if you like.</p>
         <h3>Other work</h3>
         <p>Another small tool I made is <a href="activity-log/">Activity Log</a>, which is meant to be used for tracking time. It's a really cool project, with a nice design and charts and everything. I'm trying to make this an Android app.</p>
         <p>My really old work includes some games; they are still up on my GitHub.</p>
         <br>
         <h2 id="workflow">Tools</h2>
         <p>Languages: JavaScript, Java, Python, GDscript, Kotlin, C++</p>
         <p>IDEs: VS Code, Android Studio, Godot built-in, Eclipse, VEXcode (sadly)</p>
         <h3>Software</h3>
         <p>Browser of choice is Firefox, keyboard layouts are programmer's dvorak (~100wpm) and arabic 101 (like 10wpm).</p>
         <p>Windows 11 (unfortunatly), Fedora 39 KDE Spin, and ChromeOS for school.</p>
         <h3>Opinions</h3>
         <p>I use Python, sometimes, when I can't avoid it. The worst parts are how variables are declared and the dependance on indentation.</p>
         <p>The type checking in Java is actually really nice.</p>
         <p>I use open source when possible.</p>
