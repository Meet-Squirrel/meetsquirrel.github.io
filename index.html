         <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
         <p>I'm a high school student and spend just about all my spare time programming. I've mostly done full stack web dev, but am learning Kotlin for Android development, and trying out Godot for the school Game Dev Club. Also in school robotics! Writing C++ for that (doing Vex robotics). Used to use Linux (Kubuntu), waiting to use it again (prob. Fedora). Btw, I use the programmer's dvorak (~100 wpm).</p>
         <br>
         <h2 id="work">Work</h2>
         <p>Like I mentioned above, I've been just experimenting around recently. Working on a bunch of small projects in Python, GDscript, Java, and Kotlin. Until I find something good enough to stick with, because web dev doesn't sound great as a career choice. If you want to see whatever project I'm working on this week, it'll be up on my GitHub.</p>
         <p>A ambitious project I was working on in JavaScript was <a href="https://github.com/hnasheralneam/git-organized">Git Organized</a>, a project management and planning tool; web hosting isn't working right now, but you can set it up yourself if you like.</p>
         <h3>Other work</h3>
         <p>Another small tool I made is <a href="activity-log/">Activity Log</a>, which is meant to be used for tracking time. It's a really cool project, with a nice design and charts and everything. I'm trying to make this an android app.</p>
         <p>I also made a small JS library called <a href="digit/">Digit</a>, which writes out long numbers in words. I'm still polishing this, and plan on adding time related features; this is probably the most useful thing I've made.</p>
         <p>My really old work includes some games, the best of which are <a href="vegetable-dash/">Vegetable Dash</a> and <a href="gold-rush/">Gold Rush</a>.</p>
         <br>
         <h2 id="workflow">Tools</h2>
         <p>When working with JavaScript: Node.js, Ejs, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB</p>
         <p>Android development: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Android Studio</p>
         <p>Game development: Godot, GDscript</p>
         <p>Python, sometimes, when I can't avoid it. The worst parts are the dependance on indentation and variable declaration</p>
         <p>Some Java, with Eclipse because Comp Sci A. The type checking is actually really nice</p>
         <h3>Software</h3>
         <p>Browser of choice is Firefox, because there is enough chromium in the world.</p>
         <p>IDE depends on the language, but usually VS code.</p>
         <p>Blender, Kdenlive, Simplenote, Inkscape, Gimp</p>
         <p>Trying to switch to more open source stuff, like libreoffice. It's not bad, just having everything online is helpful because I can't exactly install libreoffice write on a school chromebook.</p>
         <p>For operating systems, I have to use Windows now, but hate it with a passion. As soon as possible, I'm switching to Linux and never looking back.</p>
